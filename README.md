# ProjectPasta
A dumb exercise to learn using pandas taking pastas' cooking time and see if i manage to keep up with 1 daily update. 

The cooking time is taken on a csv with 4 categories for each type of pasta considered: cruda(raw), al dente(undercoocked but edible), cotta (coocked), stracotta(overcoocked); and the script for graphs is in python.
Data gathered cooking on the same pot with similar water quantity, my kitchen is 283m on see level

This proect is done with Python3 with tcl-TK-qt Api installed, all other packages are automatically donwloaded as long as pip is updated.
